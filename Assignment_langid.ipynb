    "\n",
    "Your trigram recognizer will consist of four files. Step by step specifications are given below. **Study the specifications carefully and make sure your work meets all the requirements.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This overview summarizes the sections that follow. If there seems to be disagreement between this summary and the detailed description, follow the detailed description.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core functionality: The module `langdetect.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "This module will define some important core functions, and any other helper functions you find useful. They include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `trigram_table()`: Calculate and _return_ a trigram frequency table from a string.\n",
    "- `read_table()` and `write_table()`: Functions that read, resp. write, a list of trigrams and their frequencies.\n",
    "- `cosine_similarity()`: Return the cosine similarity score between two frequency tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three scripts: Create profiles, match languages\n",
    "\n",
    "All three scripts should import necessary functions from the module `langdetect`. Do not copy-paste code or reimplement any operations that `langdetect.py` can already handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `write_profiles.py`: reads a directory of multilingual files and saves trigram frequency tables for later use. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. `matchlang.py`: The language recognizer. This is a general-purpose program with command-line arguments and options. It can also be imported as a module, allowing the recognizer to be used by another program.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `evaluate.py`: This script will apply the recognizer to two collections of test files, and measure and report the success of the recognition process."

    "\n",
    "Read the instructions carefully. Many of the necessary concepts and \n",
    "skills are covered in the forthcoming reading and practica (up to the \n",
    "deadline).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Credit.** Projects will be graded on function (correct results, design according\n",
    "to the specification) as well as form (organization and appropriateness \n",
    "of the code, documentation). **Test** the parts of your program to\n",
    "ensure that they work as intended. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Specification.** Ensure that your modules and functions **exactly** meet the specifications given here, including naming and arguments. (Extra _optional_ arguments are fine.) Adherence to specifications is essential for the components of a complex system to work together. You are free (and encouraged) to structure your code by defining additional functions, optional arguments, etc. If you wish to go beyond the requirements of the assignment, you are welcome to. Just ensure that your additions do not conflict with the specifications. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Module structure.** When imported, your modules should only provide definitions; they must not read or write data files, generate output, or carry out any lengthy calculations. Modules intended to be used as stand-alone scripts must have a conditional section that executes the code. (For modules that don't have such use, you are free to add a conditional section to help with development and debugging.) \n",
    "\n",
    "**Paths.** Do not use absolute paths for files. Use arguments rather than hard-coded names wheverer possible. Use forward slashes (\"/\") to separate components. Unlike backslashes (\"\\\"), they do not need escaping and they work on both Windows and Unix (OS X, Linux) systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Form.** Follow our recommended best practices on variable naming, line length, and \"docstrings\" for all functions and modules. Functions should avoid relying on global variables; use function arguments to pass information. Avoid code repetition; if you find it useful to copy and paste your code to more than one place, you should factor it out into a function. Finally, if you are aware that some part of your code has a problem but are unable to fix it, document the problem in a comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function.** In addition to producing correct results, beware of excessively long running times. They indicate a mistake in your algorithm, or an unsuitable data structure somewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, be aware that **your code will be evaluated with a different data set.** Do not hard-code paths and filenames in your code, except as directed. Ensure that your code pays attention to function arguments and command-line arguments. Make sure that the code runs correctly when a non-default value for any argument is used."

It must compute and return the \"cosine similarity\" metric between the two tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula of cosine similarity between *a* and *b* is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\cos(a,b)=\\frac{a\\cdot b}{magnitude(a)*magnitude(b)}$\n",

    "The cosine similarity metric ranges between `-1.0` and `1.0`. Larger is better (smaller angle, i.e. more similar vectors). An ngram table compared to itself should return cosine `1.0`. Unrelated ngram tables should return cosine of around `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an ngram does not appear in an ngram table, it has frequency 0 and contributes nothing to the numerator in the formula nor to the table's vector magnitude. So when comparing two tables,  trigrams that don't occur in either do not affect cosine measure because they do not contribute either to the dot product or the tables' vector magnitudes. This means that our calculations need only consider trigrams that occur in one of the tables: The dot product (numerator) is the sum over trigrams that are present on both sides (since other products are zero), and the magnitude of each vector (denominator) is calculated from its own trigrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the dot product of the following vectors is $2 * 2$, and each vector has magnitude $\\sqrt {2*2+1}$. The cosine score works out to $2*2/(\\sqrt {2*2+1}*\\sqrt {2*2+1})=4/5$.\n",

The initializer should define and store a dictionary whose keys are language names, and each value is itself a dictionary whose keys are ngrams and whose values are frequencies. These are read from the profile file with `langdetect.read_trigrams()`. (Use just the language name as the key, not the complete file name).\n",

Compute its ngram table, limited to `ngrams`  most frequent ngrams (default 200), and compare it against each of the languages in the model dictionary. Compile a list of the language names and cosine similarity scores, and return the names and similarity scores for the `n` best matches.\n",
